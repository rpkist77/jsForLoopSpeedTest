# jsForLoopSpeedTest
Simple Node.js App to test the different kinds of for loops and their speeds. This is done via randomly generating a brand new array of random numbers and feeding it to each of the 5 array methods for testing.

The app can be ran via:
```
npm run build
npm run start
```
You may optionally apply command line arguments after which specify the number of test iterations and the length of the array, respecticely:
```
npm run start 10000 10000
```
They default each to 1000 if none are supplied.
